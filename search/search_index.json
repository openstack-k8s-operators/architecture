Thus, there are non-relative links in the <code>MkDocs</code> content to the pages hosted on github.</p> <p>Though it's possible to create symbolic links to README files or link to a directory above the <code>docs</code> directory, the resulting HTML will contain invalid links unless all READMEs are moved out of the directories that they describe. However, this would make reading the CRs more complicated as they wouldn't have a corresponding README.</p> <p>Thus, if you add a new VA or DT, then please just link it in the <code>mkdocs.yml</code> file, similar to the way the HCI VA is linked, in to keep the <code>MkDocs</code> output up to date.</p>"},{"location":"faq/cr_by_components/","title":"Creating Smaller CRs","text":""},{"location":"faq/cr_by_components/#question","title":"Question","text":"<p>The kustomize command builds and results in the OpenStack control plane definitions and its dependent Custom Resources (CR). <pre><code>kustomize build architecture/examples/va/hci &gt; control-plane.yaml\n</code></pre> The <code>control-plane.yaml</code> file contains CRs for the <code>NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy</code> (NNCP), the <code>NetworkAttachmentDefinition</code>, MetalLB resources and OpenStack resources.

E.g. the file <code>nncp.yaml</code> would contain only <code>NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy</code> CRs and <code>NetworkAttachmentDefinition</code> and other CRs could exist in another file like <code>networking.yaml</code>. The following process may be used to generate these files using kustomize.</p> <ul> <li>Modify the va/hci/kustomization.yaml file so that the components list only has the nncp component: <pre><code>components:\n- ../../lib/nncp\n</code></pre></li> <li>Generate a file with only NNCP CRs: <pre><code>kustomize build architecture/examples/va/hci &gt; nncp.yaml\n</code></pre></li> <li>Modify the va/hci/kustomization.yaml file so that the components list only has the networking component: <pre><code>components:\n- ../../lib/networking\n</code></pre></li> <li>Generate a file with only Networking CRs: <pre><code>kustomize build architecture/examples/va/hci &gt; networking.yaml\n</code></pre></li> </ul> <p>The above process may be continued for each component.</p> <p>Note that va/hci/kustomization.yaml is not the same file as examples/va/hci/kustomization.yaml. <code>/example/va/hci</code> is a specific example of a given VA where as <code>/va/hci</code> is a generic HCI VA that may be customised and shared in multiple examples or composed to make a larger VA.</p> <p>This process will work for VAs (and DTs) besides HCI, but the paths may be different. E.g. examples/va/nfv/sriov/kustomization.yaml differs from va/nfv/sriov/kustomization.yaml and the later is in an <code>nfv</code> subdirectory so each component is referred to using <code>- ../../../lib/</code> instead of <code>- ../../lib/</code>.</p>"}]}
