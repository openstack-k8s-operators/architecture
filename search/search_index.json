E.g. the file <code>nncp.yaml</code> would contain only <code>NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy</code> CRs and <code>NetworkAttachmentDefinition</code> and other CRs could exist in another file like <code>networking.yaml</code>. The following process may be used to generate these files using kustomize.</p> <ul> <li>Modify the va/hci/kustomization.yaml file so that the components list only has the nncp component: <pre><code>components:\n- ../../lib/nncp\n</code></pre></li> <li>Generate a file with only NNCP CRs: <pre><code>kustomize build architecture/examples/va/hci &gt; nncp.yaml\n</code></pre></li> <li>Modify the va/hci/kustomization.yaml file so that the components list only has the networking component: <pre><code>components:\n- ../../lib/networking\n</code></pre></li> <li>Generate a file with only Networking CRs: <pre><code>kustomize build architecture/examples/va/hci &gt; networking.yaml\n</code></pre></li> </ul> <p>The above process may be continued for each component.</p> <p>Note that va/hci/kustomization.yaml is not the same file as examples/va/hci/kustomization.yaml. <code>/example/va/hci</code> is a specific example of a given VA where as <code>/va/hci</code> is a generic HCI VA that may be customised and shared in multiple examples or composed to make a larger VA.</p> <p>This process will work for VAs (and DTs) besides HCI, but the paths may be different. E.g. examples/va/nfv/sriov/kustomization.yaml differs from va/nfv/sriov/kustomization.yaml and the later is in an <code>nfv</code> subdirectory so each component is referred to using <code>- ../../../lib/</code> instead of <code>- ../../lib/</code>.</p>"}]}
