| FIPS                                           | default                       | Must have          |

## Considerations/Constraints
1. barbican will need to user a specific HA config for the HSM config. Example [Config](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/OSP-DFG-security/automation/-/blob/master/playbooks/lunasa-17.1-ha.yaml.j2)
2. The ansible playbook will do the HA failover testing. Example [playbook](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/OSP-DFG-security/automation/-/blob/master/playbooks/run_barbican_nshield_HA_test.yml) Please note that we will have to do this iptables blocking of an HSM access differently as we are dealing with Openshift pods now.

## Testing tree

| Test framework                    | Stage to run | Special configuration | Test case to report  |
| ----------------                  | ------------ | --------------------- | :-----------------:  |
| Ansible playbook                  | stage8       |                       |                      |
