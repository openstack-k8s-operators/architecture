# Deployed Topology - Nova/nova04delta

If you are looking for information on how to deploy the nova04delta based DT, then
please see the 
[README](../../../examples/dt/nova/nova04delta/README.md) in the examples
directory.

This directory ,`dt/nova/nova04delta/`, exists so that the
[kustomization.yaml](../../../examples/dt/nova/nova04delta/edpm/nodeset/kustomization.yaml)
in the examples directory of nova04delta topology, reference it by path as a
component. It's contents are likely uninteresting unless you want to understand
how kustomize was implemented in this repository.
