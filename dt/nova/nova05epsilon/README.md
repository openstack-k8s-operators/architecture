# Deployed Topology - Nova/nova05epsilon

If you are looking for information on how to deploy the nova05epsilon based DT, then
please see the
[README](../../../examples/dt/nova/nova05epsilon/README.md) in the examples
directory.

This directory ,`dt/nova/nova05epsilon/`, exists so that the
[kustomization.yaml](../../../examples/dt/nova/nova05epsilon/edpm/nodeset/kustomization.yaml)
in the examples directory of nova05epsilon topology, reference it by path as a
component. It's contents are likely uninteresting unless you want to understand
how kustomize was implemented in this repository.
