# Deployed Topology - Delta

If you are looking for information on how to deploy the Unified Delta deployed
topology of OpenStack Services on OpenShift, then please see the
[README](../../examples/dt/uni04delta-ipv6/README.md) in the examples directory.

This directory, 'dt/uni04delta-ipv6/', exists so that the
[kustomization.yaml](../../examples/dt/uni04delta-ipv6/kustomization.yaml) in the
examples directory of unified-delta topology, reference it by path as a
component. It's contents are likely uninteresting unless you want to
understand how kustomize was implemented in this repository.
