# OpenShift on OpenStack - Deployment topology type 3

Please refer the [README](../../examples/dt/shiftstack/README.md) if you
are looking for information on how to deploy the type 3 deployment topology
of OpenShift on OpenStack.

This directory `dt/shiftstack/`, exists so that the
[kustomization.yaml](../../examples/dt/shiftstack/kustomization.yaml) in
the examples directory of shiftstack, reference it by path as a
component. It's contents are likely uninteresting unless you want to understand
how kustomize was implemented in this repository.
