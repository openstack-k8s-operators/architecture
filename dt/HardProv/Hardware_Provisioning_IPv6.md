| Service                 | configuration             | Lock-in coverage? |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Nova                    |  default                  |  Must have        |
| Keystone                |  default                  |  Must have        |
| Glance                  |  default                  |  Must have        |
| Cinder                  |  (Do we need cinder if we only support BFV in odd cases which we canâ€™t directly support because a lack of lvm iscsi support |  Possible  |



## Considerations/Constraints

1. Going on the presumption that OpenShift isn't already configured with IPv6 by default, would need a build configured for that.  Basing this on the impression that IPv6 would be needed in OpenShift in order for IPv6 to work in the hosted OpenStack

## Stages

_(existing sample, not necessarily relevant to ironic/hardprov)_
All stages must be executed in the order listed below.  Everything is required unless otherwise indicated.

1. OpenShift host configured for IPv6 (presuming it isn't already IPv6 by default)
2. [Install dependencies for the OpenStack K8S operators](stage1)
3. [Install the OpenStack K8S operators](stage2)
4. [Configuring networking on the OCP nodes](stage3)
5. [Configure and deploy the control plane](stage4)
6. [Configure and deploy the data plane](stage5)
7. Install and run Tempest (?)
8. Collect logs
