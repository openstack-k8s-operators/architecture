# CHANGEME:
#
# - Change the storage size of the requested PVC to be as large as your largest
#   expected image after it has been converted into RAW format with a command
#   like `qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O raw cirros.img cirros.raw`. When an image
#   is uploaded, Glance will use this space to convert it to RAW so that Ceph
#   can create volumes and VMs from the image efficiently using COW references.
