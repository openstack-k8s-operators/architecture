# Deployed Topology uni-delta

**Based on OpenStack K8S operators from the "main" branch of the [OpenStack Operator repo](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/openstack-operator/commit/7354503e770cbb0435700e2e5b2707de9f7d90e5)**

## Purpose

This is a twin of uni04delta, but it deploys IPv6 networks instead of IPv4.

Please refer to that DT for details.
