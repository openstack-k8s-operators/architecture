# Deployment Topologies

All validated architectures ([VAs](../va/)) are deployment topologies
(DTs), but not all DTs are VAs.

DTs represent CI optimizations. We design them to test lots of things
together so we can have as few of them as possible. Before proposing a
new DT to test something, consider if an update to an existing DT will
achieve the same result.
