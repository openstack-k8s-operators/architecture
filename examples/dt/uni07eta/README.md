# Deployed Topology - Eta

This document contains a list of integration test suites that would be
executed against the below specified topology of Red Hat OpenStack Services
on OpenShift. It also contains a collection of custom resources (CRs) for
deploying the test environment.

## Purpose

This topology is used for executing integration tests that evaluate the
multiple backends and networker.

## Environment

### Services, enabled features and configurations

| Service          | configuration            | Lock-in coverage?  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Cinder           | iSCSI (netapp) multipath | Must have          |
| Cinder Backup    | SwiftBackupDriver        | Must have          |
| Glance           | Cinder (iSCSI)           | Must have          |
| Swift            | (default)                | Must have          |
| Octavia          | OVN provider             | Must have          |
| Horizon          | N/A                      | Must have          |
| Barbican         | (default)                | Must have          |
| Neutron          | Geneve (OVN)             | Must have          |

#### Support services

The following table lists services which are not the main focus of the testing
(which may be covered by additional scenarios), but are required for the DT to
work properly and can be deployed with any/default configuration.

| Service          | Reason                     |
| ---------------- |--------------------------- |
| Nova             | needed by scenario testing |
| Keystone         | needed by all services     |

### Additional configuration

- iSCSI service is enabled on all OpenShift nodes.
- Multipath service is enabled on all OpenShift nodes.

#### iSCSI

It is assumed *iSCSI* services are enabled in all nodes participating in the
Red Hat OpenShift cluster. If not, a `MachineConfig` similar to the below one
is applied. The node would be *rebooted* after applying the configuration.

```YAML
---
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master
    service: cinder
  name: 99-master-cinder-enable-iscsid
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.2.0
    systemd:
      units:
        - enabled: true
          name: iscsid.service
```

#### Multipath

It is assumed *multipath* services are enabled in all nodes particpating in the
Red Hat OpenShift cluster. If not, a `MachineConfig` like the one below must be
applied. The node would be *rebooted* after applying the configuration.

```YAML
---
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfig
metadata:
  labels:
    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master
    service: cinder
  name: 99-master-cinder-enable-multipathd
spec:
  config:
    ignition:
      version: 3.2.0
    storage:
      files:
        - path: /etc/multipath.conf
          overwrite: false
          # Mode must be decimal, this is 0600
          mode: 384
          user:
            name: root
          group:
            name: root
          contents:
            # Source can be a http, https, tftp, s3, gs, or data as defined in rfc2397.
            # This is the rfc2397 text/plain string format
            source: data:,defaults%20%7B%0A%20%20user_friendly_names%20no%0A%20%20recheck_wwid%20yes%0A%20%20skip_kpartx%20yes%0A%20%20find_multipaths%20yes%0A%7D%0A%0Ablacklist%20%7B%0A%7D
    systemd:
      units:
      - enabled: true
        name: multipathd.service
```



## Workflow

1. [Install the OpenStack K8S operators and their dependencies](../../common/README.md)
2. [Configure and deploy the OpenStack control plane](control-plane.md)
3. [Configure and deploy the OpenStack networker deployment](networker.md)
4. [Configure and deploy the OpenStack data plane](data-plane.md)
