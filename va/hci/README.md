# VA: HCI

If you are looking for information on how to deploy the HCI VA, then
please see the
[HCI README in the examples directory](../../examples/va/hci/README.md).

This directory, `architecture/va/hci/`, exists so that the
[kustomization.yaml](../../examples/va/hci/kustomization.yaml)
in the examples directory for the HCI VA, reference it by path as a
component. Its contents are likely uninteresting unless you want to
understand how kustomize was implemented in this repository.
