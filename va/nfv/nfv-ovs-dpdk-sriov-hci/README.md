# VA: OvS DPDK & SRIOV HCI

If you are looking for information on how to deploy the OvS DPDK & SRIOV HCI VA, then
please see the
[OvS DPDK & SRIOV HCI README in the examples directory](../../../examples/va/nfv/nfv-ovs-dpdk-sriov-hci/README.md).

This directory, `architecture/va/nfv/nfv-ovs-dpdk-sriov-hci/`, exists so that the
[kustomization.yaml](../../../examples/va/nfv/nfv-ovs-dpdk-sriov-hci/kustomization.yaml)
in the examples directory for the OvS DPDK & SRIOV HCI VA, reference it by path as a
component. Its contents are likely uninteresting unless you want to
understand how kustomize was implemented in this repository.
