# VA: OvS DPDK SR-IOV Nicpartition

If you are looking for information on how to deploy the OvS DPDK & SR-IOV
nicpartiton VA, then please see the
[OvS DPDK & SR-IOV Partition README in the examples directory](../../../examples/va/nfv/ovs-dpdk-sriov-partition/README.md).

This directory, `architecture/va/nfv/ovs-dpdk-sriov-partition/`, exists so that the
[kustomization.yaml](../../../examples/va/nfv/ovs-dpdk-sriov-nicpartitoin/kustomization.yaml)
in the examples directory for the OvS DPDK & SR-IOV Nicpartiton VA, reference it by path as a
component. Its contents are likely uninteresting unless you want to
understand how kustomize was implemented in this repository.
