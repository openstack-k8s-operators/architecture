# VA: PIDONE

If you are looking for information on how to deploy the PIDONE VA, then
please see the
[PIDONE README in the examples directory](../../examples/va/pidone/README.md).

This directory, `architecture/va/pidone/`, exists so that the
[kustomization.yaml](../../examples/va/pidone/kustomization.yaml)
in the examples directory for the PIDONE VA, reference it by path as a
component. Its contents are likely uninteresting unless you want to
understand how kustomize was implemented in this repository.
